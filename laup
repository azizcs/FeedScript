Creating Business Events for LAUPD AppLaunch in PAT Dynatrace
For your LAUPD application with the single critical AppLaunch function (URL: /laupd/bootstrap), here's a streamlined approach to implement business events and LEI monitoring:

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Create Business Event for AppLaunch
Navigate to Business Events:

Go to: Settings > Server-side service monitoring > Business events

Click "Add business event"

Configure AppLaunch Event:

Name: LAUPD_AppLaunch

Primary dimension: Request

Rule configuration:

text
entity.type == "SERVICE"
AND entity.name == "LAUPD_Service"
AND request.path == "/laupd/bootstrap"
Optional dimensions (add if relevant):

request.method (probably GET)

request.header.x-custom-header (if you have important headers)

request.query.parameter (if URL has important parameters)

2. Configure LEI Framework
Navigate to LEI Settings:

Go to: Settings > Monitoring > Load efficiency indicator

Either create new or modify existing configuration

Add AppLaunch as Key Transaction:

Add the LAUPD_AppLaunch business event

Set thresholds:

Performance threshold: [Set your target response time, e.g., 1000ms]

Error rate threshold: [Typically 1% or lower]

Weight: 100% (since it's your only critical function)

3. Create Monitoring Dashboard
Create new dashboard:

Go to: Dashboards > Create dashboard

Name: "LAUPD AppLaunch Monitoring"

Add key widgets:

LEI score for LAUPD_AppLaunch

Response time chart for /laupd/bootstrap

Error rate chart

Topology map showing dependencies

User sessions affected by poor performance

4. Set Up Alerts
Create management zone (if needed):

Go to: Settings > Management zones

Create zone for LAUPD services

Configure alerting profile:

Go to: Settings > Alerting > Alerting profiles

Create profile "LAUPD Critical Alerts"

Add rules:

LEI score below [threshold]

Error rate increase for LAUPD_AppLaunch

Response time degradation

Validation Steps
Generate test traffic:

Make several calls to /laupd/bootstrap

Verify events appear in "Transaction & services" view

Check LEI calculation:

Go to: Applications & microservices > Load efficiency indicator

Verify LAUPD_AppLaunch appears and shows data

Test alerts:

Force an error condition

Verify alert triggers appropriately
