VS Code Tools & Extensions
1. Basic Analysis Extensions
ASP Classic/VBScript Syntax Highlighter - For proper syntax coloring

VBScript Language Support - Better IntelliSense and syntax validation

File Utils - For counting files and lines across the project

2. Line Counting
bash

Copy

Download
# Using PowerShell in VS Code terminal:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.asp | Get-Content | Measure-Object -Line

# Using find (if you have Windows Subsystem for Linux):
find . -name "*.asp" -exec wc -l {} +
3. Code Metrics Extensions
Code Metrics - Measures complexity (though limited for ASP Classic)

Line Counter - Specifically counts lines of code

Visual Studio 2022 Approach
1. Create a Solution/Project
Create an empty ASP.NET project

Add your ASP files as "Content" files

Use VS's built-in analysis tools

2. Built-in Analysis Tools
Code Metrics Calculator (via Analyze menu)

Find All References for dependency mapping

Architecture Explorer for code structure

Specialized Security Analysis Tools
1. Security Scanners
Microsoft Security Code Analysis Extension

SonarLint (limited ASP Classic support)

VisualCodeGrepper - Specifically for classic ASP/VB

2. ASP Classic Specific Tools
ASP-Audit (command-line tool)

CodeScan (commercial, good ASP support)

Manual Analysis Methods
1. Technology Stack Identification
vbscript

Copy

Download
' Look for these patterns in your code:
' Database connections: ADODB.Connection, SQL queries
' Includes: <!--#include file="..."-->
' COM components: Server.CreateObject
' Session/Application state usage
2. Security Vulnerability Checks
SQL injection vulnerabilities (Request.QueryString, Request.Form without validation)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) opportunities

File inclusion risks

Authentication/authorization flaws

Recommended Workflow
Phase 1: Inventory & Metrics
Use VS Code with line counting extensions

Create a file inventory with basic statistics

Identify main technology patterns

Phase 2: Security Analysis
Run VisualCodeGrepper for security issues

Manual review of authentication flows

Database interaction analysis

Phase 3: Architecture Understanding
Map include file dependencies

Identify main business logic flows

Document COM component usage

Specific Tools for Your Case
Given your file names suggest enterprise-level code, I'd recommend:

Start with VS Code + these extensions:

"VBScript" by Michel Calhoun

"ASP Classic" by John Johnson

"Code Metrics" by Kris van der Mast

For security:

Download and run VisualCodeGrepper

Focus on SQL injection and file inclusion vulnerabilities

For architecture:

Create a dependency graph using include statements

Use Dependency Walker for COM component analysis

Would you like me to provide specific instructions for any of these approaches, or do you have a particular aspect (security, metrics, architecture) you'd like to focus on first?

Security
Security Analysis for ASP Classic Codebase
Here's a comprehensive security analysis approach for your ASP Classic code:

1. Immediate Security Tools
Primary Security Scanner
VisualCodeGrepper (VCG) - Specifically designed for classic ASP/VB

bash

Copy

Download
# Download and run VCG against your codebase
VisualCodeGrepper.exe -f "C:\your\asp\code\path" -t asp
VS Code Security Extensions
Security Scan - Basic vulnerability detection

Vulnerability Scanner - Pattern-based security analysis

2. Critical ASP Classic Security Vulnerabilities to Scan For
SQL Injection Patterns
asp

Copy

Download
<!-- DANGEROUS PATTERNS -->
<%
sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " & Request.QueryString("id")
sql = "INSERT INTO table VALUES ('" & Request.Form("name") & "')"
%>

<!-- SECURE PATTERN -->
<%
Set cmd = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Command")
cmd.Parameters.Append cmd.CreateParameter("@id", adInteger, adParamInput, , Request.QueryString("id"))
%>
File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
asp

Copy

Download
<!-- VULNERABLE -->
<!--#include file="<% =Request.QueryString("template") %>"-->

<!-- SECURE -->
<!--#include file="fixed_file.asp"-->
3. Manual Security Review Checklist
Authentication & Session Management
asp

Copy

Download
' Check for:
If Session("admin") = True Then ' Weak session management
If Request.Cookies("auth") = "secret" Then ' Insecure authentication
Input Validation Issues
asp

Copy

Download
' Look for missing validation:
user_input = Request.Form("username")
' Should have validation like:
If IsNumeric(user_input) Then
If Len(Trim(user_input)) > 0 Then
File Operations Security
asp

Copy

Download
' Dangerous file operations:
Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
fso.DeleteFile(Request.QueryString("file")) ' User-controlled file deletion
4. Automated Security Script
Create this PowerShell script for initial security scanning:

powershell

Copy

Download
# SecurityScan.ps1
$aspFiles = Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.asp

# SQL Injection Patterns
$sqlPatterns = @(
    "Request\.QueryString[^&]*&",
    "Request\.Form[^&]*&",
    "exec\(|sp_",
    "xp_cmdshell"
)

# XSS Patterns
$xssPatterns = @(
    "Response\.Write.*Request",
    "<%=",
    "alert\("
)

foreach ($file in $aspFiles) {
    $content = Get-Content $file.FullName -Raw
    Write-Host "Scanning: $($file.Name)"

    foreach ($pattern in $sqlPatterns) {
        if ($content -match $pattern) {
            Write-Warning "Possible SQL Injection in $($file.Name): $pattern"
        }
    }
}
5. VS Code Search Patterns
Use these regex patterns in VS Code search:

SQL Injection Detection
text

Copy

Download
Request\.(QueryString|Form)\[["'][^"']+["']\][^&]*&
exec\(.*Request
sp_.*&.*Request
XSS Detection
text

Copy

Download
Response\.Write.*Request
<%=.*Request
Server\.Execute.*Request
File Inclusion Risks
text

Copy

Download
#include.*Request
Server\.MapPath.*Request
6. Critical Files to Prioritize
Based on your file list, focus on these high-risk files:

High Priority Security Review:

admin.asp - Admin functionality

backdoor.asp - Suspicious name! ⚠️

emer_login.asp - Emergency login

authfailed.asp - Authentication logic

deleterecordsadmin.asp - Data deletion

edit*.asp - All edit functions

7. Database Security Analysis
Check for these connection patterns:

asp

Copy

Download
' UNSAFE connection strings in code
connStr = "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=db;User Id=sa;Password=password;"

' Look for hardcoded credentials
' Check if connection strings are in external config files
8. Specific Code Patterns to Hunt
Authentication Bypass
asp

Copy

Download
' Look for hidden admin parameters
If Request("admin") = "true" Then Session("admin") = True
If Request("debug") = "1" Then ' Debug modes that bypass security
Direct Object Reference
asp

Copy

Download
' User-controlled file access
file = Request("file")
Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
fso.OpenTextFile(Server.MapPath(file))
9. Quick Security Assessment Command
Run this in your project root:

bash

Copy

Download
# Count security-sensitive patterns
grep -r "Request\.QueryString" *.asp | wc -l
grep -r "exec(" *.asp | wc -l
grep -r "Scripting.FileSystemObject" *.asp | wc -l
grep -r "password" *.asp -i | wc -l
10. Immediate Action Items
Run VisualCodeGrepper first - it's specifically made for ASP Classic

Manually review backdoor.asp - this filename is a major red flag

Check all admin pages for authentication bypass possibilities

Scan for hardcoded credentials in connection strings

Review file upload/download functionality for path traversal

Next Steps:
Would you like me to:

Provide a more detailed analysis of specific file patterns?

Help you set up automated security scanning?

Create a custom security review checklist for your specific codebase?

Explain how to fix common ASP Classic security issues?

The file backdoor.asp in your list is particularly concerning from a security perspective - I'd recommend reviewing that file immediately.
